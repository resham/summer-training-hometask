Introduction
------------
I am Rashmi,a student of CSE department from Dr. B.C.Roy Engineering college,Durgapur.
Summer training is a better approach to gain knowledge for newcomers.With thehelp of mentors and little effort a person can gain a lot.I am new to programming then also ,although slowly,trying to get whatever our mentor guides us to do.I really thanks all the persons conducting the 'SUMMER TRAINING 2013'.
I hope, i will gain much.
